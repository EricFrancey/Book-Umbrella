In the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to market dominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles   the collective intelligence   locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.    Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.    This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

    "longDescription": "From rather humble beginnings as the Personal Home Page scripting language, PHP has found its way into almost every server, corporation, and dev shop in the world. On an average day, somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP. Even when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a modern web application requires tools that decrease development time and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.    Zend Framework in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that shows how to use the Zend Framework to create web-based applications and web services. This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application. This book is organized around the techniques you'll use every day as a web developer \"data handling, forms, authentication, and so forth. As you follow the running example, you'll learn to build interactive Ajax-driven features into your application without sacrificing nuts-and-bolts considerations like security and performance.  This book is aimed at the competent PHP developer who wants to master framework-driven web development. Zend Framework in Action goes beyond the docs but still provides quick access to the most common topics encountered in the development of web applications.  ",

The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage.    Cut to reality.    You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \"corporate\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget  Don't even ask. \"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\"    Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world   not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software.    The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex.    The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). You will learn how to integrate Flex into your existing applications in order to build a next generation application that will delight users.    Flex on Java is approachable for anyone beginning Java and Flex development.    ",

Enterprise OSGi addresses several shortcomings of existing enterprise platforms, such as allowing the creation of better maintainable and extensible applications, and provide a simpler, easier-to-use, light-weight solution to enterprise software development.",
    "longDescription": "A good application framework greatly simplifies a developer's task by providing reusable code modules that solve common, tedious, or complex tasks. Writing a great framework requires an extraordinary set of skills-ranging from deep knowledge of a programming language and target platform to a crystal-clear view of the problem space where the applications to be developed using the framework will be used.    OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DM and Equinox.",

    "shortDescription": "\"Flexible Rails created a standard to which I hold other technical books. You definitely get your money's worth.\"",
    "longDescription": "Rails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUD application. Together, they're an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \"Flex Immersion.\" You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than are possible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.",

    "longDescription": "In complex software projects, managing the development process can be as critical to success as writing the code itself. A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.    Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft's Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.    Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a hands-on guide to Team Foundation Server 2008. Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems. It's not a repetition of Microsoft's product documentation. Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a practitioner's handbook for how to work with TFS under common constraints. This book walks you through real-life software engineering problems based on hundreds of hours of TFS experience.    You'll benefit from expert author Jamil Azher's extensive interactions with members of Microsoft's TFS team and MVPs, survey feedback from the author's blog, and interviews with organizations and user groups using TFS. Instead of just offering a high-level overview, the book provides detailed solutions for solving common   and not-so-common   problems using TFS. It discusses the strengths as well as weaknesses of TFS, and suggests appropriate problem resolution steps, workarounds, or custom solutions.",

Using an existing application as an example, this book guides you in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors' experiences, Brownfield Application Development in .Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you need to be successful.",

Emphasis is on standalone and web-based business applications, such as for online sales and mass customization, but much of what this book offers has broad applicability to 3D user interfaces in other pursuits such as scientific visualization and gaming.  This book provides an extensive conceptual framework for 3D user interface techniques, and an in-depth introduction to user interface support in the Java 3D API, including such topics as picking, collision, and drag-and-drop. Many of the techniques are demonstrated in a Java 3D software framework included with the book, which also provides developers with many general-purpose building blocks for constructing their own user interfaces.    Applications and their use of 3D are approached realistically. The book is geared towards sophisticated user interfaces for the \"everyday user\" who doesn't have a lot of time to learn another application--much less a complicated one--and an everyday computer system without exotic devices like head mounted displays and data gloves. Perhaps the best description of this book is: \"A roadmap from Java 3D to 'Swing 3D'.\"",

Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.    The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day - they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and insight seep out of every pore of this book.",

    "longDescription": "Microsoft describes Silverlight as a \"cross-browser, cross-platform plug-in for delivering the next generation of .NET based media experiences and rich interactive applications for the Web.\" That's a really boring description for a really exciting new technology. Anyone who has looked at the demos and gotten a taste of what Silverlight can do knows that Silverlight represents an entirely new level of rich web interface technology for Microsoft developers. With Silverlight 2, developers can use JavaScript, VB, C#, Python, and Ruby to build user-friendly, interactive, and visually-dazzling web applications that work in most major browsers.    Silverlight 2 in Action is the first book to cover Silverlight 2, a far more robust implementation of Silverlight than the current 1 release that supports only JavaScript. The much-anticipated 2 release adds powerful new features along with the ability to code in multiple languages and integrate your work with Visual Studio and the new Expression suite of tools. This book delivers real-world examples and in-depth walkthroughs to help you confidently enhance your web applications using Silverlight 2.    Silverlight 2 in Action devotes extensive coverage to flexible layout components, the extensible control model, the communication framework, and the data-binding features   all cornerstones of software development. Author and Microsoft MVP Chad Campbell also describes rich media and vivid graphical and animation features. The final chapters include a variety of Silverlight deployment scenarios.    In addition to the fundamentals of Silverlight, you'll be introduced to architectural components such as the Silverlight object model. The book addresses the developer/designer collaboration model Silverlight enables, showing the developer how to include the designer effectively in the project workflow. This model is illustrated throughout the examples.    For ongoing reader support, the author will maintain a dedicated book-support website providing up-to-the-minute working examples, complete with source code, all in Silverlight.",

    "longDescription": "Web users are getting tired of the traditional web experience. They get frustrated losing their scroll position; they get annoyed waiting for refresh; they struggle to reorient themselves on every new page. And the list goes on. With asynchronous JavaScript and XML, known as \"Ajax,\" you can give them a better experience. Once users have experienced an Ajax interface, they hate to go back. Ajax is new way of thinking that can result in a flowing and intuitive interaction with the user.\n<br>\n<i>Ajax in Action</i> helps you implement that thinking--it explains how to distribute the application between the client and the server (hint: use a \"nested MVC\" design) while retaining the integrity of the system. You will learn how to ensure your app is flexible and maintainable, and how good, structured design can help avoid problems like browser incompatibilities. Along the way it helps you unlearn many old coding habits. Above all, it opens your mind to the many advantages gained by placing much of the processing in the browser. If you are a web developer who has prior experience with web technologies, this book is for you.",

Many computing tasks require taking data from one computer system, manipulating it in some way, and passing it to another. Munging can mean manipulating raw data to achieve a final form. It can mean parsing or filtering data, or the many steps required for data recognition. Or it can be something as simple as converting hours worked plus pay rates into a salary cheque.    This book shows you how to process data productively with Perl. It discusses general munging techniques and how to think about data munging problems. You will learn how to decouple the various stages of munging programs, how to design data structures, how to emulate the Unix filter model, etc. If you need to work with complex data formats it will teach you how to do that and also how to build your own tools to process these formats. The book includes detailed techniques for processing HTML and XML. And, it shows you how to build your own parsers to process data of arbitrary complexity.    If you are a programmer who munges data, this book will save you time. It will teach you systematic and powerful techniques using Perl. If you are not a Perl programmer, this book may just convince you to add Perl to your repertoire.",

Shobana Jayaraman, Digital Infrastructure Analyst, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Library, The Tech Static",
    "longDescription": "Seam is an exciting new application framework based on the Java EE platform that you can use to build rich, web-based business applications. Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.    Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn't just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.    All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.    To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations and uses an inversion of control technical known as bijection supplemented by a liberal use of the Unified Expression Language (EL) to establish the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. You also witness how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), rule-based security, Ajax remoting, PDF generation, Spring integration, and more.",

This is accomplished by breaking individual units of functionality into services that can then be exposed through open protocols and standards.    Until recently, many of the software technologies used for developing SOA-based solutions were limited to expensive, commercial offerings. However, that has now changed, and a compelling open source SOA platform can be implemented exclusively with open source products. This book identifies a suite of open source products that can be used for a building SOA environment, and describes how they can be integrated by practitioners.

Next, it gives you a close look at Mule's standard components and how to roll out custom ones. You'll pick up techniques for testing, performance tuning, BPM orchestration, and even a touch of Groovy scripting.    Written for developers, architects, and IT managers, the book requires familiarity with Java but no previous exposure to Mule or other ESBs.",

    "longDescription": "If you are interested in Python and Tkinter, you have probably noticed that although there is some good contributed documentation on the Web, there is not enough to get Tkinter applications up and running. Python and Tkinter Programming is the answer. It is designed for readers who are familiar with Python and who need to develop applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).    Python and Tkinter Programming presents the elements of typical Python and Tkinter applications in a straight-forward fashion. Sample code illustrates each element. Complete applications that go far beyond the fill-the-form class of graphical user interfaces are presented; here you will find examples of complex controls, drawn interfaces and photorealistic panels. The code can readily be used as templates for new applications. Extensions to Python (such as ODBC) are examined as well. Complete source code for all examples, along with the latest releases of required software, will be available from Manning's web site.    Tkinter is fully documented. To date, this level of documentation has not been available to Tkinter programmers, who have been required to read the code or interpret Tcl/Tk man pages to fully understand component usage.    Python and Tkinter Programming will be useful in both Windows and Unix environments, and the example code is portable between the two environments.",

    "longDescription": "If you're a Java developer, you've almost certainly heard of OSGi   and also heard that it's becoming quite a big deal. But you may still be wondering exactly \"What is OSGi \"    Simply put, OSGi is a technology that allows you to create highly modular Java applications. It introduces a logical and physical module format, called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall modules at execution time without taking down your entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local service-oriented approach for creating applications out of loosely coupled components.    With the prevalence of modern component and service-based architectures, OSGi is becoming increasingly important. It meshes well with such approaches and greatly simplifies their creation and management. It's the backbone of Eclipse's plugin system as well as many recent JavaEE containers, such as GlassFish v3, WebSphere v6.1, and WebLogic Event Server. Even the SpringSource Application Platform is built on top of it.    OSGi in Action is a comprehensive guide to OSGi with two primary goals.    First, it provides a clear introduction to OSGi concepts with examples that are relevant both for architects and developers. The central idea of OSGi is modularity, so you start by learning about OSGi bundles.    You'll then see how OSGi handles module lifecycles and follow up with how it promotes service-oriented interaction among application components.    With the core concepts well in hand, you'll explore numerous application scenarios and techniques. How much of OSGi do you actually need  How do you embed OSGi inside other containers  What are the best practices for migrating legacy systems to OSGi  How can you embrace and make the most of system dynamism     Expert authors Richard S.

    "longDescription": "The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a new technology from Google that automatically translates Java into JavaScript, making Ajax applications easier to code and deploy. GWT in Action is a comprehensive tutorial for Java developers interested in building the next generation of rich, web-based applications. This book was written by Robert Hanson, creator of the popular GWT Widget Library, and Adam Tacy, a major contributor to the GWT Widget Library.    The Web is experiencing a new growth with an emphasis on rich, web-based applications. These applications can be difficult to build because they rely on JavaScript, which lacks the sophisticated object-oriented structures and static typing of Java, they are tricky to debug, and they require you to manage numerous browser inconsistencies.    In May of 2006 Google released the Google Web Toolkit. GWT enables developers to create Ajax applications in Java. With GWT, you can build your applications using a real object-oriented language and take advantage of Java tools like Eclipse that are already available. Instead of trying to bring tool support to Ajax, Google brought Ajax to a place where the tools already existed.    GWT in Action shows you how to take advantage of these exciting new tools. This clearly-written book is packed with hands-on GWT examples. You   ll absorb the GWT philosophy as you build your first working GWT application.    The book begins by exploring the main features of GWT, including    Compiling Java to JavaScript, the magic that really defines GWT  Building client-side components  Convenient JUnit integration and testing  Interacting with JavaScript and existing JavaScript libraries  Internationalization  You   ll also see how GWT compares to other toolkits.    GWT in Action shows you how to set up your development environment, use and create widgets, communicate with the server, and much more. Readers will follow an example running throughout the book and quickly master the basics of GWT: widgets, panels, and event handling. The book covers the full development cycle, from setting up your development environment, to building the application, then deploying it to the web server. The entire core GWT library is discussed, with details and examples on how it can be extended.    You   ll cover:    Testing, debugging, and deploying GWT Applications  Communicating with GWT-RPC  Examining client-side RPC architecture  Alternative RPC tools: HTTPRequest, RequestBuilder, and FormPanel  Achieving interoperability in GWT with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  Making your GWT application flexible and supportable  GWT helps you make the most of Ajax in your web applications and GWT in Action helps you get more out of GWT.",
